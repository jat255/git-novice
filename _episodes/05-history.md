As we saw in the previous lesson, we can refer to commits by their
identifiers.  You can refer to the _most recent commit_ of the working
directory by using the identifier `HEAD`.

We've been adding one line at a time to `mars.txt`, so it's easy to track our
progress by looking, so let's do that using our `HEAD`s.  Before we start,
let's make a change to `mars.txt`, adding yet another line.

~~~
$ nano mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
An ill-considered change
~~~
{: .output}

Now, let's see what we get.

~~~
$ git diff HEAD mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
diff --git c/mars.txt w/mars.txt
index b36abfd..93a3e13 100644

@@ -1,3 +1,4 @@

+An ill-considered change
~~~
{: .output}

which is the same as what you would get if you leave out `HEAD` (try it).  The
real goodness in all this is when you can refer to previous commits.  We do
that by adding `~1` 
(where "~" is "tilde", pronounced [**til**-d*uh*])
to refer to the commit one before `HEAD`. If you have the
`diff.mnemonicPrefix` setting enabled, the `diff` prefixes
in the output will be `c/` and `w/`, referring to the commit
(referenced with `HEAD`) and working tree, respectively.

~~~
$ git diff HEAD~1 mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If we want to see the differences between older commits we can use `git diff`
again, but with the notation `HEAD~1`, `HEAD~2`, and so on, to refer to them:


~~~
$ git diff HEAD~2 mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
diff --git c/mars.txt w/mars.txt
index df0654a..93a3e13 100644

We could also use `git show` which shows us what changes we made at an older commit as 
well as the commit message, rather than the _differences_ between a commit and our 
working directory that we see by using `git diff`.

~~~
$ git show HEAD~2 mars.txt

{: .output}

In this way,
we can build up a chain of commits.
The most recent end of the chain is referred to as `HEAD`;
we can refer to previous commits using the `~` notation,
so `HEAD~1`
means "the previous commit",
while `HEAD~123` goes back 123 commits from where we are now.

We can also refer to commits using
those long strings of digits and letters
that `git log` displays.
These are unique IDs for the changes,
and "unique" really does mean unique:
every change to any set of files on any computer
has a unique 40-character identifier.
Our first commit was given the ID
`097d1832c48997a846ee1a0628dc3d68e2f1094f`,
so let's try this:

~~~
$ git diff 097d1832c48997a846ee1a0628dc3d68e2f1094f mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

That's the right answer,
but typing out random 40-character strings is annoying,
so Git lets us use just the first few characters (typically seven for normal size projects):

~~~
$ git diff 097d183 mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
diff --git c/mars.txt w/mars.txt
index df0654a..93a3e13 100644

All right! So
we can save changes to files and see what we've changed. Now, how
can we restore older versions of things?
Let's suppose we change our mind about the last update to
`mars.txt` (the "ill-considered change").

`git status` now tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been staged:

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

{: .callout}

We can put things back the way they were
by using `git restore`:

~~~
$ git restore mars.txt   # git checkout HEAD mars.txt
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
~~~
{: .output}

As you might guess from its name,
`git restore` restores an older version of a file.
In this case, we're telling Git that we want to recover
the version of the file as it was at the last saved commit.
If we want to go back even further, we can use a commit
identifier with the `-s/--source` flag instead:

~~~
$ git restore -s 097d183 mars.txt   # git checkout 097d183 mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
$ cat mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ git status
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   mars.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
~~~
{: .output}

Notice that the changes are currently in the staging area.
Again, we can put things back the way they were
by using `git restore`:

~~~
$ git restore mars.txt   # git checkout HEAD mars.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

{: .callout}

It's important to remember that if we want to undo a change,
we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the
repository *before* the change we're trying to undo.
A common mistake is to use the number of
the commit in which we made the change we're trying to discard.
In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most
recent commit (`HEAD~1`), which is commit `f22b25e` (these commit
IDs are random and not the same as in our example to this point):

![Git Checkout](../fig/git-checkout.svg)

So, to put it all together,
here's how Git works in cartoon form:

![https://figshare.com/articles/How_Git_works_a_cartoon/1328266](../fig/git_staging.svg)

The fact that files can be reverted one by one
tends to change the way people organize their work.
If everything is in one large document,
it's hard (but not impossible) to undo changes to the introduction
without also undoing changes made later to the conclusion.
If the introduction and conclusion are stored in separate files,
on the other hand,
moving backward and forward in time becomes much easier.
